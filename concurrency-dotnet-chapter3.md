####  Thread contention

A Thread contention is a condition where one thread is waiting for an object, being held by another thread, to be released.  The waiting thread cannot continue until the other thread releases the object (itâ€™s locked).


#### System.Collection.Immutable

The namespace ```System.Collection.Immutable``` hase been added with the .NET 4.5 framework.  
The _immutable collection_ follows the functional paradigm.  

Any operations that change the data strctures don't modify the original instance. Instead, they return a changed copy and leave the original instance unchanged.

 The immutable collections have  been  heavily  tuned  for  maximum  performance  and  use  the  [Structural  Sharing pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistent_data_structure) to minimize garbage collector (GC) demands.
 
 ```cs
 var originalDictionary = new Dictionary<int,int>().ToImmutableDictionary();
 var modifiedCollection = originalDictionary.Add(key, value); //Return a new instance of the dictionary
 ```
 
 => Any changes to the collection in one thread are not visible to the other threads.
 
 
 #### Immutable collection
 
 | Immutable collection             | Mutable collection      |
 |----------------------------------|-------------------------|
 | ImmutableList<T>                 | List<t>                 |
 | ImmutableDictionary<TKey,TValue> | Dictionary<TKey,TValue> |
 | ImmutableHashSet<T>              | HashSet<T>              |
 | ImmutableStack<T>                | Stack<T>                | 
 | ImmutableQueue<T>                | Queue<T>                | 
  
  
 ####  Compare-And-Swap (CAS)
 
 The Compare-And-Swap operation is an atomic operation used in multithreaded programming.  
 The CAS instruction modifies shared data without the need to acquire and release a lock.
 
 - .NET method : ```Interlocked.CompareExchange```
 
 the ultimate combo : CAS + immutable shared data (no ABA problem)!
 
 
 #### The ImmutableInterlocked class
 
 You can use it to perform CAS operations on immutable collections.
 
 - namespace : System.Collections.Immutable
 
 #### Concurrent collection
 
 | Concurrent collection | Implementation details | Synchronization techniques |
 |-----------------------|------------------------|----------------------------|
 | ConcurrentBag<T>      | Works like a generic list | If multiple threads are detected, a primitive monitor coordinates their access =; otherwise the synchronization is avoided. |
 | ConcurrentStack<T>    | Generic stack implemented using a singly linked list | lock free using CAS technique |
 | ConcurrentQueue<T>    | Generic queue implemented using a linked list of array segments | Lock free using CAS technique |
 | ConcurrentDictionary<K,V> | Generic dictionary implemented using a hash table | Lock free for read operations, lock synchronization for updates.
 
 - the collections create an internal snapshot that mimics a temporary immutability to preserve thread safety during their iteration, allowing the snapshot to be enumerated safety
 - Those collections work well with algorithms implementing the producer/consummer pattern.
